# UC Reviews

UC Reviews is a full-stack web application built as a **senior year capstone project** at the University of Cincinnati.  
The app allows UC students to leave detailed reviews about **professors, dorms, dining halls, and parking garages**.  
Unlike traditional feedback kiosks, UC Reviews captures **contextual, actionable insights** through text reviews, star ratings, likes/dislikes, pagination, and reporting tools.  

The project was showcased at the **University of Cincinnati IT Expo (2025)**, where it received **100% in the technical evaluation**, under the supervision of **Professor Dyllon Dekok**.

## Technical Architecture

This application consists of **three components**:  

1. **Backend** – A RESTful API built using **C#** and **Entity Framework**  
2. **Frontend** – Built in **Angular**  
3. **Database** – Powered by **Microsoft SQL Server**  

The backend interacts with the database and handles requests from the frontend. It consists of:  

- **Controllers** – Each entity has a dedicated controller that handles HTTP requests and delegates logic to services.  
- **Services** – Contain application logic and serve as intermediaries between controllers and repositories.  
- **Repositories** – Abstract database operations, ensuring clean data access.

## User Personas

UC Reviews was designed around common UC community roles:  

- **Student Persona** – Wants to find reliable information about dorms, dining halls, professors, and parking.  
- **Faculty Persona** – Reviews professor feedback to improve teaching quality.  
- **Administrator Persona** – Uses the admin dashboard to moderate flagged reviews and track trends.  


## Use Case Diagram

The system supports multiple interactions:  

- **Students** – Login, browse listings, submit reviews, upvote/downvote reviews, report inappropriate content.  
- **Admins** – Moderate flagged content, view analytics dashboard, manage users if necessary.
